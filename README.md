# hello-world-html
my first git


Hello guys.! this is my first commit for using github
Im planning to use this platform to store my HTML and CSS codes as i shift my studies on Web Development
We all know that Information Technologies is consistently changing over the past years. and i knew that we will not gain expertise if we hop into other technologies overtime.
From now i will start on Web Development and i will dedicate my life on this for this coming 15 years of my life.

I was a Computer Technician, Windows Administrator, Network Administrator of a medium sized company here in the philippines.
for the past 3 years i gained vast knowledge for administering Computer and Local Network using unmanaged network switches, open source firewall (pfsense) and Windows Server 2012 R2 OS.

I am not a college Bachelor degree holder. I am Electronic Engineering associate graduate (3 year course).
I am planning to create we web development service here in the philippines. i just recently noticed that small and medium sized companies doesn't have responsive, simple but elegant websites over the internet. Their google search ranking is a mess as their content.

I want to break this barrier. I want more small companies to be seen over the internet here in the philippines that will lead for more local business information over the internet. 

Any feedback is open. thanks ~ ( '  ',  ~ )
